All of us, that's who. The television commercial has become a part of the American narrative, as important a signifier of our times as a great work of literature or a blockbuster motion picture. Indeed, we often care more about the commercials than we do about the programming itself (ask any Super Bowl aficionado). The ad is art . . . and some of the art is brilliant. The hundred commercials in this book are brilliant. They were selected by a team of experts at the Leo Burnett Company, creators of Tony the Tiger and the Maytag Repairman, in collaboration with dozens of advertising pros from around the globe and throughout the industry. Their choices represent the very best that the advertising world has to offer. Together, they portray a half century of human hopes, wishes, and dreams. Bernice Kanner, whose ""On Madison Avenue"" column in New York magazine was required reading for more than a decade, has taken each of these small masterpieces and analyzed what made them work, why they so successfully moved us, and how they broke through the clutter to become a part of the cultural landscape. From the Marlboro Man to the Energizer Bunny, The 100 Best TV Commercials provides a hundred important lessons in how we communicate and persuade today. It is vital reading for those who create our commercial culture . . . and those who live in it."

Rare, indeed. New Yorkers are among the most curious people on the planet. Just ask the staff of the popular ""F.Y.I."" column in The New York Times. They receive more than a thousand questions each year, asking everything from how Manhattan clam chowder was named to why there are so few rainbows in New York City. Here are 329 of the most intriguing questions and amusing answers about the Big Apple's history, landscape, subways, architecture, laws, and personalities. Each chapter of The Curious New Yorker offers solutions to some of the city's most confounding enigmas: ""Myths and Mysteries"" answers this puzzler: On The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, who is the woman walking arm in arm with the singer, and what Greenwich Village street are they ambling down (page 45)? ""What's in a Name?"" explains why Sixth Avenue was renamed Avenue of the Americas (p. 8), and why so many streets in Brooklyn are named after fruits (p. 40). ""Tell It to the Judge"" enlightens readers about the small print in New York's laws. Readers will learn if sitting on an apartment building stoop is trespassing (p. 241). ""New York Gazetteer"" includes the elusive formula for determining what the nearest cross street is to a numbered address on an avenue.

Unlike your mother or grandmother, you do not want to go passively (or silently) through the next half of your life. ""No one seems to care about out forty-something contraceptive needs. Pregnancy is the last thing I want at this point. What are my options?"" ""If I take the Pill and I'm over forty, am I at increased risk for cancer?"" Or: ""I know I've put it off, but I'm ready now, and I want to be pregnant--yesterday!"" What are my chances--and the risks involved?"" ""I'm going through menopause, and I'm not sure I like the idea of taking hormone replacement therapy for the rest of my life. How do I know if it's right for me? What other choices do I have?"" ""I'm too busy to consult a score of specialists to keep on the 'proper' health track. Is there a single checklist I can follow so I know what tests to take and when?"" In I'm Too Young to Get Old, renowned gynecologist Judith Reichman, M.D., creator of two acclaimed PBS series on menopause and health, gives women over forty the information they need to make their health care choices. Yes, we need to know what happens to our hormones, but that doesn't mean we should be defined in terms of our reproductive system. As Dr. Reichman writes: ""My patients have matured with me, and most of us are now over forty. Many have struggled with their health as they aged, while other seemed to mature with vibrancy, pleasure, and an increasing appreciation of their lives. What explains these differences? We traverse a complicated passage: our hormones fluctuate, and so do our moods, body temperatures, and sleep patterns. We have tomake choices about birth control, then hormone control. We should be concerned about cancer prevention and detection, heart disease, osteoporosis, joint problems, and thyroid problems. We want to control our weight and our wrinkles. And in the midst of all this, we are taking care of aging parents, aging children, or dealing with our mates' midlife problems (both physical and psychological) or possibly going through divorce, getting back in the job market, or leaving it, and wondering how we reached forty so fast."" Dr. Reichman addresses all these concerns and more with clarity and wit. She tackles subjects often given short shrift: avoiding hysterectomy, coping with urinary incontinence, exploring sexuality from forty to ninety (see the chapter on ""Sex, Hormones, and Rock 'n' Roll""), preparing for a health second half of life despite our abuses of the first half, and more. Written in a warm, accessible style and laced with the humorous perspective of someone who's gone through this stage of life herself, I'm Too Young to Get Old has all the authoritative, up-to-date information you need to take control of your future health."

As a way of coping with her feelings, she began keeping a journal. She realized her own reflections could speak to the thousands of women like her, each one with very different yet in some ways very similar day-to-day experiences. It Must Have Been Moonglow chronicles the emotional roller-coaster of her experience in a collection of brief essays—like diary entries—that capture the sadness, the humor, and the triumphs all widows encounter. She writes with wit and insight about negotiating the logistics of an evening out with a group of single older women, none of whom drive very well; about handling the check when going to dinner with a couple; about grocery shopping for one; and about the miracle of friendships on the Internet and the blessings of family. With a new final section featuring readers’ letters describing their own experiences of widowhood, It Must Have Been Moonglow is an intimate, candid, and engaging book—not about grief but about inspiration and strength."

Together, they ruled big business. They transformed popular culture. And they provoked a national controversy. More than anything, they lived a unique and rollicking American Dream, escaping the broken homes of their youth to co-create the most notoriously successful game franchises in history—Doom and Quake—until the games they made tore them apart. Americans spend more money on video games than on movie tickets. Masters of Doom is the first book to chronicle this industry’s greatest story, written by one of the medium’s leading observers. David Kushner takes readers inside the rags-to-riches adventure of two rebellious entrepreneurs who came of age to shape a generation. The vivid portrait reveals why their games are so violent and why their immersion in their brilliantly designed fantasy worlds offered them solace. And it shows how they channeled their fury and imagination into products that are a formative influence on our culture, from MTV to the Internet to Columbine. This is a story of friendship and betrayal, commerce and artistry—a powerful and compassionate account of what it’s like to be young, driven, and wildly creative. “To my taste, the greatest American myth of cosmogenesis features the maladjusted, antisocial, genius teenage boy who, in the insular laboratory of his own bedroom, invents the universe from scratch. Masters of Doom is a particularly inspired rendition. Dave Kushner chronicles the saga of video game virtuosi Carmack and Romero with terrific brio. This is a page-turning, mythopoeic cyber-soap opera about two glamorous geek geniuses—and it should be read while scarfing down pepperoni pizza and swilling Diet Coke, with Queens of the Stone Age cranked up all the way.”—Mark Leyner, author of I Smell Esther Williams"

The stories range widely across Florida history and landscapes--St. Petersburg in the 20s, Key West and Alachua County in the 30s, Coconut Grove and Jacksonville in the 50s, Miami Beach in the 60s, and Ft. Lauderdale in the 70s. Andrew Lytle recounts violent events in an Indian village during the Spanish rule. Sarah Orne Jewett and Stephen Crane treat maritime Florida in the 19th century while Hemingway and Philip Wylie present stories of the 20th century. From the pinewoods of northern Florida, through cracker farms, boom towns, and coastal suburbs, to the swamps and the Keys, we meet characters both common and extraordinary: moonshiners, socialites, carnies, sailors, scavengers, and fugitives. McCarthy's collection reveals the impact of a rich human and natural environment on the work of these distinguished writers. In the process it captures the uniquely Floridian coincidence of the exotic and mundane."

In Hidden Lives, Barbara J. Heath re-creates the daily life of slaves at Jefferson's second home from 1773, the year he inherited the plantation, until 1812, when his reorganization of its landscape resulted in the destruction of a slave quarter. Drawing on census data, letters, memoranda, and other primary material, Heath describes the slave community's family ties, the agricultural cycle of work, and the sickness and health care they experienced. Her portrait is enhanced by fresh archaeological findings and a wealth of illustrations, including site and contemporary maps,../images of slaves at work and at home, artifacts, and interpretive drawings. By looking at the social meaning of buildings, yards, and artifacts, Heath presents new interpretations of how individuals used materials to create a sense of self and community, how they acquired belongings, and how they safeguarded them. For visitors to historic sites and students and scholars of archaeology, Heath's book offers a visual and textual exploration of complex relationships within the plantation and of the resulting choices, compromises, and limitations that Jefferson's slaves negotiated in the process of making a home within the confines of institutionalized slavery."

Published in 1963 when historical archaeology was in its infancy, Here Lies Virginia details the archaeology and excavation of Roanoke Island, Jamestown, Williamsburg, and Yorktown, Virginia. Combining artifacts and written records, Ivor Noel Hume provides an intimate portrait of colonial life. In his new Afterword, Noel Hume discusses the changes that have taken place in the field of historical archaeology since the book was first published thirty years ago. He uncovers both the advantages and the shortcomings of computer technology in archaeology as well as problems caused by the separation of artifact studies from archaeological site interpretation. This first paperback edition will bring back into print a treasury of the archaeological history of Virginia."

Yet he was persistently troubled throughout his career by the difficulty of finding adequate authority in language. Matthew Arnold and the Betrayal of Language explores Arnold's attempts to find an authoritative language, and argues that his occasional claims for such a language reveal more uneasiness than confidence in the value of """"letters."""" It examines Arnold's poetry within this context and demonstrates that his various experiments-- to speak in oracular voice, to use classic forms, to achieve a grand style-- and their failures, reflect the inevitable difficulties facing any poet in an age of intellectual and cultural upheaval. Riede argues that Arnold's determined efforts to write with authority, combined with his deep-seated suspicion of his medium, result in an exciting if often agonized tension in his poetic language-- a language that strains against its inevitable but generally unacknowledged limitations."

All the stories are set in India, but the people in them seem somehow displaced within their own society--a society in transition but a transition that does not come fast enough to help them. Appachana manages to capture the pervasive humor, poignancy, and self-delusion of the lives of the people she observes, but she does so without seeming to pass judgments on them. She focuses on unexpected moments, as if catching her characters off guard, lovingly exposing the fragile surfaces of respectability and convention that are so much a part of every society, but particularly strong in India, with its caste system, gender privileges, and omnipresent bureaucracies. All life seems to be prescribed; these characters bravely or cautiously confront the rules and regulations or finally give in to them resignedly--any small triumphs they achieve are never clear-cut. One of the most unusual aspects of many of the stories is the way in which they are informed by but never ruled by the author's feminism. She never lectures her readers but lets us see for ourselves: a bride caught in a hopeless marriage where she has given up all rights to any life of her own, a hapless college student who is confined to campus for minor infractions just at the time when she had an appointment for an abortion, a young girl who keeps the dark secret of her sister's rape, a woman executive and a digruntled male clerk both trapped in the intricate bureaucracy of their business firm and the roles they must play to survive there. By turns warm, gullible, arrogant and bigoted, all of these characters live their lives amid contradictions and double standards, superstitions and impossible dreams. Appachana's vision is unique, her writing superb. Readers will thank her for allowing them to enter territory that is at once distant and exotic but also familiar and recognizable."

Following the Buckley ruling and other legislation in 1996, candidates and political parties are free to raise virtually unlimited “soft” money, making money perhaps the most significant factor in a campaign's success. In Moey Rules, Anthony Gierzynski theorizes that, under our current system of financing elections, our political process has tilted too far in favor of political freedom, at the expense of political equality. Gierzynski examines the historical roots of the campaign finance dilemma, demonstrates its effects on the local, state, and national levels, and projects the long-term outcomes for American politics."

In many places that has changed very little. In the West, however, herbal and botanical cures have long been ignored in favor of ""scientific medicine."" But the benefits of medicinal plants are being rediscovered in many developed countries, where consumers are turning to such therapies in place of, and in addition to, Western medical treatments. And, all over the world, the drive to lower the cost of health care has made herbals and botanicals an attractive alternative to more expensive synthetic remedies. In 1978, the World Health Organization responded to increased interest in medicinal plants by convening a series of international consultations, seminars, and symposia to explore and promote the use of medicinal plants. Medicinal Plants presents the proceedings of the last of these symposia, held in 1993. It brings together an vast range of information and presents an overview of the use of medicinal plants that includes a discussion of a variety of issues—scientific, economic, regulatory, agricultural, cultural—focused on the importance of medicinal plants to primary health care and global health care reform."

It laid the foundations of France's national consciousness, even while destroying the prosperity and political preeminence which France had once enjoyed. It formed the nation's institutions, creating the germ of the absolute state of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In England, it brought intense effort and suffering, a powerful tide of patriotism, great fortune succeeded by bankruptcy, disintegration, and utter defeat.

In Songs My Mother Sang to Me, she has preserved the oral histories of many of these women before they have been lost or forgotten. Martin's quest took her to ranches, mining towns, and cities throughout southern Arizona, for she sought to document as varied an experience of the contributions of Mexican American women as possible. The interviews covered family history and genealogy, childhood memories, secular and religious traditions, education, work and leisure, environment and living conditions, rites of passage, and personal values. Each of the ten oral histories reflects not only the spontaneity of the interview and personality of each individual, but also the friendship that grew between Martin and her subjects. Songs My Mother Sang to Me collects voices not often heard and brings to print accounts of social change never previously recorded. These women document more than the details of their own lives; in relating the histories of their ancestors and communities, they add to our knowledge of the culture and contributions of Mexican American people in the Southwest."

With a sure grasp of shifting cultural dynamics, Banes shows how postmodern dance is integrally connected to other oppositional, often marginalized strands of dance culture, and considers how certain kinds of dance move from the margins to the mainstream. Banes begins by considering the act of dance criticism itself, exploring its modes, methods, and underlying assumptions and examining the work of other critics. She traces the development of contemporary dance from the early work of such influential figures as Merce Cunningham and George Balanchine to such contemporary choreographers as Molissa Fenley, Karole Armitage, and Michael Clark. She analyzes the contributions of the Judson Dance Theatre and the Workers' Dance League, the emergence of Latin postmodern dance in New York, and the impact of black jazz in Russia. In addition, Banes explores such untraditional performance modes as breakdancing and the ""drunk dancing"" of Fred Astaire."

Murray N. Rothbard's classic The Ethics of Liberty stands as one of the most rigorous and philosophically sophisticated expositions of the libertarian political position. What distinguishes Rothbard's book is the manner in which it roots the case for freedom in the concept of natural rights and applies it to a host of practical problems. An economist by profession, Rothbard here proves himself equally at home with philosophy. And while his conclusions are radical—that a social order that strictly adheres to the rights of private property must exclude the institutionalized violence inherent in the state—his applications of libertarian principles prove surprisingly practical for a host of social dilemmas, solutions to which have eluded alternative traditions. The Ethics of Liberty authoritatively established the anarcho-capitalist economic system as the most viable and the only principled option for a social order based on freedom. This edition is newly indexed and includes a new introduction that takes special note of the Robert Nozick-Rothbard controversies."

They also provide evidence that baptism in the Spirit belongs not to the personal experience of the few, not at al to private piety, but to the public official liturgy of the Church. Baptism in the Spirit is therefore normative. The authors, supported by letters of encouragement from two bishops, suggest ways in which the baptism in the Holy Spirit can be reappropriated by the local parish. Here are the sources of renewal, of on-going conversion, of the power of evangelization. For this reason, this document is of interest to pastors, liturgists, RCIA teams, people involved in the catechumenate, spiritual directors and those in spiritual formation."

Can these prayers enhance the prayer life of such believers? By examining fifty-five psalms, the author demonstrates how these prayers can speak to different stages in the life of individuals and communities. Some speak to moments of balance and harmony. Others look to our times of disaster and disillusionment. Still others reflect on God's capacity to surprise and change our lives. They are indeed Psalms for all Seasons. A blend of biblical scholarship and pastoral theology, this work is especially well-suited for adult Bible study groups, college courses, prayer groups, those who pray the Liturgy of the Hours, or any group or individual with an interest in the psalms.

In this light-hearted, lively tour of sexuality within Jewish religion and culture, Dr. Ruth Westheimer and Jonathan Mark team up to reveal how, contrary to popular wisdom, the Jewish tradition is much more progressive in many regards than one might think. Applying Dr. Ruth's unique brand of couples therapy to such Biblical relationships as Abraham and Sarah, and Joseph and Potiphar's wife, the authors enlist Biblical lore to cover such topics as surrogacy, incest, and arranged marriages. They offer a clearer understanding of the intertwining relationships between sexuality, spirituality, and sexual roles through a look at the latter books of the Bible—The Song of Songs, Ruth, Proverbs, Psalms, and some of the bawdier tales of the Prophets. One chapter provides a provocative metaphorical perspective on the Sabbath as a weekly revival, highlighting not only its spiritual, but its marital and sexual aspects as well. Focusing specifically on Orthodox forms of Judaism and offering Dr. Ruth's singular interpretations, the book answers such questions as: What night of the week is best for making love? How often should couples have sex? Can traditional Jewish notions of sex and sexuality be reconciled with contemporary beliefs? What roles can and do dreams and fantasy play? Heavenly Sex familiarizes the reader with a generous and lusty religious tradition that has too often been lost within the rubric of a larger Christian culture with a completely different view of sexuality."

The authors' preventive defense strategy concentrates on the dangers that, if mismanaged, have the potential to grow into true threats to U.S. survival in the next century.

Closely Watched Trains is the subtle and poetic portrait of Milos Hrma, a timid young railroad apprentice who insulates himself with fantasy against a reality filled with cruelty and grief. Day after day as he watches trains fly by, he torments himself with the suspicion that he himself is being watched and with fears of impotency. Hrma finally affirms his manhood and, with a sense of peace and purpose he has never known before, heroically confronts a trainload of Nazis."

Late in his life, confined to a chair or bed, Matisse transformed a simple technique into a medium for the creation of a major art. “I have attained a form filtered to its essentials.” Cutting dynamic shapes from painted paper, Matisse created his images. While producing pieces for Jazz, the artist used a large brush to write notes to himself on construction paper. The simple visual appearance of the words pleased Matisse, and he suggested using his reflective handwritten thoughts in juxtaposition with the images. The original edition of Jazz was an artist’s book, printed in a limited quantity.

D.'s supposed ""fallow"" period. As these pages reveal, she was in fact writing a great deal of important poetry at the time, although publishing only a small part of it. The later, wartime poems in this section form an essential prologue to her magnificent Trilogy (1944), the fourth and culminating part of this book. Born in Pennsylvania in 1886, Hilda Doolittle moved to London in 1911 in the footsteps of her friend and one-time fianc Ezra Pound. Indeed it was Pound, acting as the London scout for Poetry magazine, who helped her begin her extraordinary career, penning the words ""H. D., Imagiste"" to a group of six poems and sending them on to editor Harriet Monroe in Chicago. The Collected Poems 1912-1944 traces the continual expansion of H. D.'s work from her early imagistic mode to the prophetic style of her ""hidden"" years in the 1930s, climaxing in the broader, mature accomplishment of Trilogy. The book is edited by Professor Louis L. Martz of Yale, who supplies valuable textual notes and an introductory essay that relates the significance of H. D.'s life to her equally remarkable literary achievement."

To reconstruct the ingenious methods used by earlier generations to make a house a home and to keep themselves warm and well-fed, she squirmed through drains, poked around sculleries and cellars, and clambered into icehouses and up chimneys. The result of her explorations is an informative, amusing text that recounts not only the history of the kitchen, the bathroom, and the laundry, but also investigates bakehouses and breweries, dairies and dovecotes, the lamp room and the larder.

But Makiguchi had spent a lifetime as an educator, developing his ""value creating"" educationai philosophy, before he founded Soka Gakkai. In the 1930s he proposed educational reforms that were fully as revolutionary as those advanced by his American counterpart John Dewey. He is one of Japan's most significant yet perhaps least recognized educators. Makiguchi said that Japan's educational system was haphazard, unplanned, fragmented, and useless. Convinced that the pursuit and creation of values are the ultimate purpose of life, he proposed a ""value creating"" educational system. Defining the three greatest values in life as goodness, beauty, and gain, Makiguchi held that through education people should increase their ability to create values and thus find happiness."

Genesis 1-11: God Makes a Start helps Bible-study participants put the creation story in its proper historical, cultural, and theological contexts, and goes beyond the story of creation to discuss the first sin and God's starting over with the flood. In the end, we come to see the story of creation--and re-creation--as part of God's ongoing story with us today. A Guided Discovery of the Bible The Bible invites us to explore God's word and reflect on how we might respond to it. To do this, we need guidance and the right tools for discovery. The Six Weeks with the Bible series of Bible discussion guides offers both in a concise six-week format. Whether focusing on a specific biblical book or exploring a theme that runs throughout the Bible, these practical guides in this series provide meaningful insights that explain Scripture while helping readers make connections to their own lives. Each guide * is faithful to Church teaching and is guided by sound biblical scholarship * presents the insights of Church fathers and saints * includes questions for discussion and reflection * delivers information in a reader-friendly format * gives suggestions for prayer that help readers respond to God's word * appeals to beginners as well as to advanced students of the Bible By reading Scripture, reflecting on its deeper meanings, and incorporating it into our daily life, we can grow not only in our understanding of God's word, but also in our relationship with God."

Lydia Whittaker's horrid Uncle Henry has cast her, her widowed mother, and sisters out of their Yorkshire home. Now Lydia must not only hand over the estate she has thriftily managed for years, but also enter the marriage mart. This is far from her desire...until her heart is set a-flutter by the very first man she meets. Lieutenant Edward Whittaker has been quite preoccupied with squandering his allowance on the pleasures of London. And when his father announces his intentions for him -- a cavalry commission and a wealthy, simpering society bride -- Edward is far from charmed. On his arrival in the country, he is refreshingly intrigued, however, by Lydia's dimpled smile and keen wit. But as soon as the feuding Whittakers observe the bloom of feelings between the two cousins, Lydia's mama puts up a dreadful din, and Uncle Henry threatens to disinherit Edward. Can two young hearts outwit their wrangling, scheming relations to prove that love can conquer all...?"

In other words, to observe and draw what we actually see, rather than what we think we see. When it comes to drawing the human figure, this means letting go of learned ideas and expectation of what the figure should look like. It means carefully observing the interplay of form and light, shape and line, that combine to create the actual appearance of human form. In The Artist’s Complete Guide to Figure Drawing, amateur and experienced artists alike are guided toward this new way of seeing and drawing the figure with a three-step drawing method. The book’s progressive course starts with the block-in, an exercise in seeing and establishing the figure’s shape. It then build to the contour, a refined line drawing that represents the figure’s silhouette. The last step is tonal work on the inside of the contour, when light and shadow are shaped to create the illusion of form. Separate chapters explore topics critical to the method: gesture, which expresses a sense of living energy to the figure; light, which largely determines how we see the model; and form, which conveys the figure’s volume and mass. Examples, step-by-steps, and special “tips” offer helpful hints and practical guidance throughout. Lavishly illustrated with the author’s stunning artwork, The Artist’s Complete Guide to Figure Drawing combines solid instruction with thoughtful meditations on the art of drawing, to both instruct and inspire artists of all levels."

There was the Chanel of the most sumptuous baroque, of dazzling, playful, unrestrained jewelry, of diamonds and emeralds shimmering like stars, and there was the Chanel of the tailored suit and the little black dress, of the severe cut, the strand of pearls, of classicism à la française. Out of this dialogue between hyperbole and understatement, and in counterpoint to the costume jewelry that she gave to the world, she created jewelry that was unparalleled in its insistence on luxury and refinement and unfettered in its imagination. Her jewelry presents one of the least known aspects of her work. With more than 120 illustrations and based on archival research and interviews with Chanel's colleagues and other witnesses to her life and career.--From publisher description."

Once back in Tokyo, he receives love letters from a fervent young woman who begs him to meet her--importunings that start him on a bizarre round of romantic adventures.

These tales described how the gods created the earth and its life, how the stars were created, and why the days are longer in summer. Other stories recounted the pranks of Kamapuaa the Pig-Man, the origin of the tapa tree, the death of the monster reptile mo-o, and the home of the volcano goddess, Pele. From this rich body of mythology, author Vivian Thompson has drawn twelve myths. She retells them with the true flavor and simplicity of the storytellers of long ago. Thompson's words are accompanied by the illustrations of Hawaii artist Marilyn Kahalewai, who has captured the delight and drama of the ancient tales."

For the first time, reviews, interviews, and articles about Madonna -- from the popular to the academic press -- are gathered together to give a complete picture of the performer and phenomenon who has shaken the music business -- and American culture -- to the core.

This work concentrates exclusively on the fighting between the American and Japanese aircraft carriers, examining how strategies were planned and carried out on both sides. Presented are the stories of the USS Hornet, which launched the B-25s of James Doolittle's daring raid of Tokyo in 1942; the USS Yorktown, which suffered fierce attacks during the Battle of Midway; the USS Lexington, which refueled and rearmed Hellcats during the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot; the USS Enterprise, the leader of a motley assortment of cruisers and destroyers left to hold a very precarious line in the campaign for Guadalcanal; and the Japanese battleship Yamato, sacrificed for a suicide mission against 900 aircraft bombers."

Crosby,2000,McFarland &amp; Company,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0786408480.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0786408480.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0786408480.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg,"This book examines the spiritual dimensions found in the literature of the fantastic (science fiction, fantasy, and magical realism) by linking such novels to actual currents within the feminist spirituality movement. Fusing popular culture studies, women's studies, and close textual analysis, the author moves beyond earlier studies that fail to address the genre's use of goddess worship, psychic phenomena, and reverence for the earth. She reveals how such attributes betoken a spiritual awakening with profound implications for contemporary feminism. Special emphasis is given to both the struggle to provide an alternative to men-centered experience and to the need to articulate ways in which feminists can achieve personal and social power. The authors studied represent a variety of American voices, and include both firmly established and newer writers such as Marion Zimmer Bradley, Kim Chernin, Alice Walker, Mercedes Lackey, Patricia Kennealy, Gael Baudino, Octavia Butler, Lynn Abbey, Joan Vinge, Toni Morrison, Gloria Naylor, Ntozake Shange, and Starhawk."

When they are remembered, they are most often thought of as terrorists; this passive ignorance has allowed most Westerners to forget their terrible plight. The author was one of those Palestinians expelled from Jerusalem, and in this work he describes in vivid detail the nakba (tragedy, or catastrophe) that his people faced. His story is of the dissolution of his homeland and the systematic effacing of his cultural roots and history. He explores the events leading up to the establishment of a Zionist state and looks to the future as a time for change. Providing an upclose look at the Palestinian people, the author reminds us that policy decisions do not affect countries, but truly the people."

You don't mess with married women. It's tempting, sure. Forbidden Fruit. He got, I want. But you're only buying trouble and there's enough trouble to be had for nothing."" So says police officer Ray Dolan. But when the sultry Sheila Travis moves in next door, the rules go out the window. Line of Sight is a stunning example of the neo-noir genre, complete with breathtaking plot twists, crackling dialogue, and sizzling eroticism. It promises to establish Kelly as one of the most stylish writers of crime fiction, on a level with Elmore Leonard, James Ellroy, and Walter Mosley. Ray Dolan is a man haunted by looking. He spends his days keeping watch over a decaying rust-belt city, his nights peering at the stars. Then the seductive glimpse of a woman's shape in a window draws him into a nightmare of murder and accusation. Dolan knows who's innocent and who's guilty. But does he know how to escape from a terrifying sexual and moral labyrinth The story unfolds in prose that has the glint of a knife blade in the dark. The explosive novel reminds the reader that each of us walks through a minefield of hidden obsession and unexpected passion. A wrong step, a wrong look, can transform our desires into violence with lethal suddenness. Line of Sight brings to mind noir classics like Double Indemnity and Body Heat. At the same time, the novel goes beyond the hard-boiled genre to explore the moral and emotional dimensions of obsession, crime, and police power in American society."

An intensive feminist qualitative study, the book offers guidelines for counselors and lesbian step families for creating healthy, functioning family structures and environments. It is the first book to concentrate exclusively on lesbian step families rather than on lesbian mothering in general.In Lesbian Step Families: An Ethnography of Love, you'll explore in detail the different kinds of step relationships that are developed and what factors may lead to the different types of step mothering in lesbian step families. The book helps you understand these relationships and parent roles through in-depth discussions of: how a step mother and legal mother who live together negotiate and organize parenting and homemaking tasks how members of lesbian step families define and create the step mother role strategies family members use to define and cope with oppression how sexism is transmitted within the family and how mothering may limit and/or contribute to female liberation the opinions and viewpoints of the children of these families The findings in Lesbian Step Families: An Ethnography of Love challenge traditional views of mothering and fathering as gender and biologically based activities; they indicate that lesbian step families model gender flexibility and that the mothers and step mothers share parenting--both traditional mothering and fathering--tasks. This allows the biological mother some freedom from motherhood as well as support in it. With insight such as this, you will be prepared to help a client, a loved one, or yourself develop and maintain healthy family relationships."

This new edition focuses on the source of a message for change, its development as a platform for leadership communication, and its many forms of expression from speeches to e-mails, memos, and even informal ""water cooler"" conversation. Pearce shows leaders in business, politics, and nonprofits how to communicate their values and vision to inspire commitment; he provides tools and examples from well-known leaders as well as less-known but effective change agents. Leading Out Loud gives readers concrete methods for improving their own communication by guiding them to do the internal work necessary for creating an honest and compelling vision, and by demonstrating how readers can find their authentic voice and articulate their messages with confidence. People make commitments, says Pearce, to causes they value and to people they respect and trust. An authentic voice and an inclusive perspective are requisites for any leader who would inspire change. Trust is built by communicating from both the mind and the heart, speaking directly to the minds and hearts of others, listening to their response, and respecting their points of view. All leaders will benefit from Pearce's wisdom, as will anyone else who wants to inspire positive change through others."

At the same time, there has been a decrease in the number of these crimes solved - in the past thirty years there has been a 25 percent drop in the solution rate for homicide alone. Law enforcement officials feel mounting public pressure to apprehend perpetrators as quickly as possible, yet their efforts are hampered by poor communication between police departments, a lack of common terminology, and the increased mobility of criminals. Each police department has traditionally operated independently, using its own investigative techniques and its own language and definitions, with limited interdepartmental training. The Crime Classification Manual is a diagnostic system that will standardize terminology and for the first time formally classify the critical characteristics of the perpetrators and victims of the three major violent crimes - murder, arson, and sexual assault. It is the result of nearly a decade of study of murderers, rapists, child molesters, abductors, and arsonists at the FBI's National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime in Quantico, Virginia. This new standard system will put into the hands of police officers - in any size community, in any size department - the same investigative techniques and definitions used by the FBI to coordinate their investigations and solve crimes. The Crime Classification Manual identifies for investigators the clues and crime scene indicators common to each type of crime, so they can begin piecing together a solution and establishing a motive as soon as they arrive at the crime scene. Once a general idea of the perpetrator and the motive has been established, investigators can use the CCM to identify the other aspects common to that type of crime: victimology, modus operandi, physical evidence, the weapon, autopsy results, etc. What's more, the CCM offers invaluable how-to advice on such topics as staging and personation, crime scene photography and the analysis of crime scene photos, prescriptive interviewing, guidelines on the use of search warrants, and more. And its unique and useful numbering system can be easily adopted and implemented in police departments and bureaus nationwide. The Pocket Guide to the Crime Classification Manual presents in handy outline form the data in the main volume and serves as a quick in-the-field reference tool for CCM users. The Crime Classification Manual will serve as an indispensable manual for investigators, prosecutors, mental health professionals, criminal justice and correctional institution personnel, as well as criminologists, policymakers, and anyone else whose work brings them into contact with either the offender or victim of violent crime."

Instead, he shows how communications can be used strategically to connect an organization's vision, mission and business goals to the forces and opportunities in the marketplace -- the driving force behind all change. Includes D'Arpix's market-based strategic communications model for integrating and aligning communications at all levels."

While the controversies over Beard's book have quieted, the issues which it raised have hardly abated. Indeed, one can say that just about every major work in the politics and economics of the American nation must contend with Beard's classic work. Beard's work rests on an examination of primary documents: land and slave owners, geographic distribution of money, ownership of public securities, the specific condition of those who were disenfranchised as well as those who were in charge of the nascent American economy."

Teenager Ali Warner has reason to cling to such a fantasy. Her mother died in a car accident a year ago. Her father, a trucker determined to work through his grief, hasn't acknowledged Ali's burgeoning figure or complicated emotions. Her friends still aren't sure how to talk about her mother's death. And the Southern California forest that has always been Ali's refuge is about to be ravaged by logging. Ali is about to discover that she is a princess-a fairy princess. And that she has to save the world. For real. To claim her fairy powers, Ali must overcome seven potentially lethal challenges. Then she must scale a mountain and confront the King of the Dwarves and the King of the Elves, whose armies are poised to invade Earth. With her bemused 21st century friends, a sly leprechaun, and an extremely loyal, extremely ugly, troll by her side, Ali begins the most momentous journey of her young life, a journey during which she will learn much about herself and the past she thought she knew. She will conquer fire and water, earth and air, and even time itself. She will be both betrayer and betrayed, will see death close at hand, and will snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Ali Warner is Alosha. Welcome to her world."

With its rich sense of place and history, All Elevations Unknown offers a surprisingly fresh twist to an adventure-climbing tale.” –Climbing Magazine In the spring of 1999, armed with little more than a description from a book and a map labeled “all elevations unknown,” Sam Lightner and his German rock-climbing buddy, Volker, found themselves deep in the jungles of Borneo on a mission to climb a mountain that was only rumored to exist. What little they knew about the mountain they had learned from the memoirs of Major Tom Harrisson, a British World War II soldier who in 1945 had been assigned the near-impossible mission of parachuting blindly into the thick Borneo rainforest–where the natives had a grisly habit of cutting off heads–to try to reclaim the island for the Allies. A captivating, utterly original combination of travel adventure memoir and historical re-creation, All Elevations Unknown charts Lightner’s exhilarating and at times harrowing quest to ascend the mountain Batu Lawi in the face of leeches, vipers, and sweat bees, and to keep his team together in one of the earth’s most treacherous uncharted pockets. Along the way, he reconstructs a fascinating historical narrative that chronicles Tom Harrisson’s adventures there during the war and illuminates an astonishing piece of forgotten World War II history. Rife with suspense and vivid detail, the two intertwining tales open up the island of Borneo, its people, and its history in a powerful, unforgettable way, taking adventure writing to new heights."

No image of the American West in the mid-1800s is more familiar, more beloved, and more powerful than that of the lone rider galloping the mail across hostile Indian territory. No image is more revered. And none is less understood. Although rooted in actual events and real people, the saga of the Pony Express has become an American legend, embellished in everything from Mark Twain's ""Roughing It, Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, and dime novels, to the western film classics of John Ford, the art of Frederic Remington, and scores of children's books. ""Orphans Preferred is both a revisionist history of this magnificent and ill-fated adventure and an entertaining look at the often larger-than-life individuals who created and perpetuated the myth of ""the Pony,"" as it is known along the Pony Express trail that runs from Saint Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento, California. The Pony Express is a story that exists in the annals of Americana where fact and fable collide, a story as heroic as the journey of Lewis and Clark, as complex and revealing as the legacy of Custer's Last Stand and as muddled and freighted with yarns as Paul Revere's midnight ride. ""Orphans Preferred is a fresh and exuberant reexamination of this great American story."
